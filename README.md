## About

ACNH Tracker is an application for tracking your catalogue in Animal Crossings: New Horizon. It allows users to easily keep track of items they own, and items they want. You can also compare your catalogue to other users to see what items they have that you need, and vice versa. This makes it easy to set up catalogue parties!

## Technologies

The front end of ACNH Tracker is made in React (hooks), and the backend API is made in Node.js (express and mongoDB).
